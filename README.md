## 🧓🏻 Organize within your community

If you’re part of a community group, association or organization, publish a statement in support of the protestors. If possible, band together with other groups to sign a joint statement.

Hold discussions within your diaspora communities, with folks who are on the fence or self-identified centrists. But approach with caution if folks are already staunchly against the protests.

## 🤳🏼 Spread the word on social media

Some tips on spreading the word on social media:

- Don't post unverified information.
- Post trigger warnings before revealing images of blood and violence.
- Think about your audience: Do your friends really want to read seven heavily-captioned posts, or do they prefer a single post summary?
- Engage carefully with friends & family: Sometimes it's best to agree to disagree and move on for now.
- Engage carefully (or not at all) with the trolls: Do you really need to win that argument on the internet with someone you don't know?
